    <h1>Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
        <small> types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables.
There are five basic data types in JavaScript.<br>
which can be divided into three main categories:</small><br> <u>
1]Primitive data types (or primary):-</u><br>
In JavaScript 5 primitive data types are present these are:
 <br><strong><mark> 1.string, 
    2.number, 
    3.boolean, 
    4.null, 
    5.undefined
    </mark></strong> 
   <br>
<strong>Number data type :</strong> 
Unlike many other programming languages,JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers.
Numbers. Let’s talk about numbers. Numbers are as straightforward as they sound. Numbers are for numbers. 
It’s no longer green. But can make this number be as long as I want it. cannot add a comma, but can add a decimal point.
So numbers are any integer or decimal number created in the language, and they’re used for money, age, etc. the same kinds of things that we use money for here in real life.
<br>
<strong>
String data type :</strong>
A string data type is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. 
The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).
<br>


<strong> Boolean data type:</strong>
Booleans can only have two values. True and false.
They represent all data that only has two states, like a light switch. On or off. 
<br>


<strong>
Undefined data type:</strong>
The undefined data type means that the variable has been created, but has never been given a value. 
It is nothing because no one has ever bothered to tell it what value it should be. 
<br>
<strong>
Null data type:</strong>
Null is similar to undefined, except it has to be set intentionally. 
It also means empty or nothing, but it’s that way because a developer told it it was empty or nothing. 
The difference is undefined exists when we haven’t given a value.<br>

<br>
<u>2]Composite data types (or reference):-</u><br>
   Object, Array, and Function<br>
<strong>
Objects and Arrays :</strong>
 An object or array are collections, a way to group together multiple points of data into a single bundle that we can pass around using access.<br>
